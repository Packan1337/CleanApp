### Project Name: **CleanApp**

### Project Description
CleanApp is a Flask-based web application designed to streamline the management of household tasks. It provides user management functionalities including sign-up, login, profile management, and task assignments. The application leverages a MySQL database to store user data, profiles, and tasks, enhancing interaction through dynamic web pages.

### Features:
- **User Authentication:** Secure login and signup features with password hashing.
- **Profile Management:** Create, edit, and delete user profiles.
- **Task Management:** Add custom tasks, assign tasks to profiles, and manage them efficiently.
- **Dynamic Task Initialization:** Predefined tasks are initialized on application start if they are not present in the database.
- **Responsive Web Interface:** Organized with separate HTML templates for functionalities like user management, profile management, task management, and password resets.

### How to Set Up and Run:
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://your-repository-url.com/cleanapp.git
   cd cleanapp
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Make sure Python is installed, then run:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure Database Settings:**
   Update the MySQL database URI in the application configuration to point to your database server.

4. **Initialize the Database:**
   With the application context, run the database initialization to create tables and pre-load some tasks:
   ```
   from app import db
   db.create_all()
   ```

5. **Run the Application:**
   Start the server using:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

6. **Access the Application:**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:80/` in your web browser to access CleanApp.

### Directory Structure:
- **app.py:** Main application file containing Flask routes and configurations.
- **db_models.py:** SQLAlchemy ORM models for database interactions.
- **/templates:** Folder containing HTML templates for different pages and functionalities.
- **/static:** Folder containing CSS stylesheets and JavaScript files for front-end design.

### Contributing:
Contributors can fork the repository, make proposed changes, and submit a pull request for review. Contributions to enhance features, improve user interface design, or fix bugs are welcome.

### `.gitignore`:
Ensure files like Python environment directories (`venv/`), bytecode (`__pycache__/`), and local settings (`app_local.py`) are included in `.gitignore` to prevent unnecessary tracking by git.

This README provides a general guide on how to set up and use the CleanApp project. Adjust it as needed based on additional functionalities or specific deployment instructions you might have.
